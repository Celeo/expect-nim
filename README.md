### Note: You're probably better off using `check` from the [unittest](https://nim-lang.org/docs/unittest.html#check.m%2Cuntyped) module

# expect-nim

`expect` for Nim. Heavily inspired by [Jest's expect](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect).

## Usage

1. Install with `nimble install https://github.com/celeo/expect-nim`
1. Import with `import expect`
1. Assert with `expect<what>(<args>)`

See the source for the different assertions that are available.
